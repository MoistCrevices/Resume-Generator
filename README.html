<h1 id="resume-generator">Resume-Generator</h1>
<p>A simple free resume generator available at <a href="http://ineedaresu.me">http://ineedaresu.me</a></p>
<p>I&#39;m currently in the middle of mid-term exam week here, so I haven&#39;t been able to update it much. This right here is like version 0.0.1. The code is a little sloppy and inefficient at the moment, but I&#39;m working to clean it up! I&#39;ll probably rebuild it with knockout or something in the coming days!</p>
