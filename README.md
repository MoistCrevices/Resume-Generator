# Resume-Generator
A simple free resume generator available at http://ineedaresu.me

I'm currently in the middle of mid-term exam week here, so I haven't been able to update it much. The code is still a little sloppy and inefficient at the moment, but I'm working to clean it up! 

**Play with it, figure out how it works, do whatever, but please don't redistribute it or put it online as your own thing. Thanks!**
