# Resume-Generator
A simple free resume generator available at http://ineedaresu.me

I'm currently in the middle of mid-term exam week here, so I haven't been able to update it much. This right here is like version 0.0.1. The code is a little sloppy and inefficient at the moment, but I'm working to clean it up! I'll probably rebuild it with knockout or something in the coming days!
